This project aims to provide an easy way to compile [Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) files to HTML. It will generate a fully functional HTML page with CSS similar to [GitHubs' markdown](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css). The generated HTML files are placed inside an dedicated folder to be served by a web server, allowing for example a deployment of [GithHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
